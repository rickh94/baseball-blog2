The reality of baseball is that few players will stay with the same team for their entire career. Guys get traded, contracts expire, teams are cheap. So at some point, many players end up playing against their old team. These games always have a special, different energy. They build rivalries (_cough_ Sox-Yankees _cough_). 

So why does this happen?

Well there's something to be said for confirmation bias. Revenge games stick in our minds, and we want the players we lost to strike out in every at-bat, when that doesn't happen, we remember. Maybe they're in the middle of a hot streak anyway and it's a coincidence. But as much as we analyze it, baseball is a game about emotion and emotion is what we remember.

I think playing against an old team has a way of focussing batters, just a little. But that could be enough. Basebally is all about barely perceptible adjustments and split-second timing. A little more focus is sometimes all it takes.

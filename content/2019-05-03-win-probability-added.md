WPA tracks how much a player adds to your chances of winning a game. It's basically the statistic equivalent of being clutch. The best is a WPA (Clutch) Homer: one that ties the game or takes the lead. They're sweet.

This one came with two runners on. A hussle hit followed by a terrible pitching change. Take out the cruising starter to go lefty-on-lefty. As ever, the walk. Every time. Nice to be on the right side of that. Then...well we'll try to get a little extra out of the lefty reliever, even against a righty power bat who sees lefties well...what could go wr...BOOM 3-run towering shot. Win Probability Added.

Other Game notes:

* Couple extra strikeouts due to a very large (slightly hour-glass-shaped) zone.
* Just because you throw 98 doesn't mean you're good.
* In fact, guys are so used to the fireballers, they're fouling off 89 mph fastballs middle-in.

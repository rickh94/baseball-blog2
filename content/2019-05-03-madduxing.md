  Basically all the Aces have been struggling this year. The balls have been
  flying out of the ballpark, breaking pitches are flat, and they feel like they
  can't get a good grip on the baseball.


  Of course, the truly great pitchers are the ones who figure out how to deal
  with these issues, and they're starting to.


  In a game that doesn't matter to us, one ace had it all figured out,
  surrendering just three hits on no walks, and less than 100 pitches. Truly
  incredible. Not a fireballer either, pretty slow fastball, but excellent
  command of the zone, good sequencing, and a frustrated opponent. 


  The pitchers are coming. Look out.

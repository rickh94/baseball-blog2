Many people do not understand the infield fly rule. This makes sense, it is confusing. The important thing to know
is that it is to prevent a trick double-play that is basically un-defendable by the runnner on second.
Here are the conditions for the rule to be in play:

* There are fewer than two outs (otherwise double plays don't matter)
* There are runners on first and second (so that there is a force out at third base)
* The batter hits a high fly ball that stays in the infield, in what the umpires consider a routine catch.

Here is the sequence of a trick double-play that would be possible if not for the infield fly rule:

1. Once the runners see where the ball is, they return to their previous bases so that once the ball is caught, 
the infielder cannot throw behind them to get them out tagging.
1. (Here's where things get interesting) An infielder intentionally allows the ball to drop, which changes serveral
things:
    * The runners no longer have to tag.
    * The batter-runner will now be safe at first.
    * The runners on first and second now need to run to second and third, respectively, to be safe.
    * There is still a force out at third.

1. Now the infielder can throw to third for a force out (he's out because he's all the way at second tagging up).
1. The third baseman can throw to second for a force out (that runner is on first tagging up).

There is basically nothing the runner on second can do to prevent this. If they tag up, the infielder lets it 
drop and throws in front of them. If they don't tag, the infielder catches it and throws behind them.
In order to combat this, the league created the infield fly rule: as soon as an umpire determines the play to be
routine, they signal that the hitter is out, regardless of whether it is caught, so that the runners know what to do.

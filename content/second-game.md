Well it was exciting! Unfortunately, the bullpen couldn't hang on to the 9-4 lead and ended the game 11-9 for the loss.
Offense was very much still there, but a couple relievers roughed up and there went the game.

Basically everybody in the first inning. After the first out (he'll lock in), a bomb to the second deck.
No doubter in any ballpark, in any month. Five doubles. Two singles. And another, more pedestrian 340 footer from the 8-hole hitter.

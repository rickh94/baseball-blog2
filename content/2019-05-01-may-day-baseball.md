Even when they're struggling, staff aces make the team feel like they can win.
Today is no exception, though he pitched fairly well, if not deep into the game, 
the offense came through late in the game to seal the victory.

After a first inning run, the offense went quiet for a while as the opposing pitcher dealt.
But once the starter was out, the offense came alive with a double,
hit by pitch, single, and a bases loaded double, and another double 
to score him.
Add on an insurance dinger (on a cold night), and you got a nice cushion for 
the bullpen to finish it out. The bullpen was not incredible, but good enough 
and they sealed the win in the ninth.
